# Hola JS Challenge Winter 2015 (Mail Filtering Engine): Final Results

In winter 2015, we held a [programming contest](http://hola.org/challenge_mail_filter). Thanks to all who participated!

The problem statement and detailed rules are available on the contest page linked above. Now that the contest is over, we're publishing all the solutions we received, and announcing the winners.

## Statistics

We received a total of 408 submissions from 237 different participants. Only the last submission from each participant, received within the deadline, is published here in the `submissions` directory.

An additional 7 solutions were submitted either after the deadline or by Hola employees, and we considered them hors concours (off-contest). These are found in the `extra` directory.

64 solutions, or 16% of the total number, were submitted within the last 24 hours before the deadline; 15 of these were submitted within the last hour, and last one of these only 34 seconds before the deadline.

114 programs, or 48% of all participating solutions, passed our correctness tests.

The shortest correct submission is exactly 666 bytes long, while the longest one is 90274 bytes long.

## The testing methodology

The correctness and performance tests were automatic. Both kinds of testing are performed by `tests/test.js`.

The correctness tests are simple and can be found in the body of the test program. Unfortunately, many of the submissions failed on one or another corner case. Syntax errors, use of `require` (forbidden by the rules), and failure to export a `filter` function were considered correctness failures. If you are wondering why a particular solution failed, you can run the test program on the solution file and see the output.

Performance testing consisted of one large test with 100,000 messages and 100 rules. The inputs for this test (`tests/large_input.json`) were generated by `tests/generate_large_test.js`; to produce the outputs (`tests/large_output.json`), the reference implementation was used. The generating script uses a random number generator with a fixed seed, so that it produces the same output on every run. The statistical characteristics that we chose for the performance test are somewhat plausible for a real e-mail database of a typical user. Please refer to the script's source code for further details.

The performance tests were run on a 3 GHz Intel Core i7 machine running 64-bit Debian GNU/Linux (testing). Each submission was run 10 times, and the best time was selected. We re-initilized the Node.js VM with the participant's module before each call to the `filter` function. The timing was taken by the realtime clock; it included the module parsing and initialization time.

Our [reference implementation](http://hola.org/challenge_mail_filter#reference), the same as was set up on our website, is included here as `tests/reference.js`. The reference implementation includes strict input validity testing and an optional input size limitation (to restrict the load on the website); neither of these features was expected of contest submissions.

### The export controversy

After we published the contest rules, we realized that one of the requirements was ambiguous: “Your task is to write a Node.js module exporting one single function `filter(messages, rules)`”. We originally intended it to mean a named export:

```
exports.filter = function(messages, rules){ ... };
```

However, many participants interpreted it differently:

```
module.exports = function(messages, rules){ ... };
```

Both seem to be coherent interpretations of the rules, and we decided to accept either way of exporting.

Yet some other submissions did not export the function at all, but merely defined it in their source files:

```
function filter(messages, rules){ ... }
```

Because the rules clearly say “exporting”, we considered such solutions as failing. Nevertheless, we tried to fix each of these solutions and see if they would then pass. Only one solution passed, and was considered hors concours (see remark [3] in the final standings below).

## Final standings

The scores in this table are the best times achieved in performance testing, in milliseconds. Solutions for which there isn't a performance score in the table, failed correctness tests.

Because two participants shared the second place, we increased the prize budget by 500 USD, and awarded them 750 USD each. Finally, we decided to award the 350 USD special prize to the author of the shortest correct submission.

Congratulations to the winners!

### Remarks

[1] We disqualified one participant for trying to fool the test framework. Check their solution if you want to see how. Interestingly, the submission still wasn't the fastest.

[2] Two participants share the second place because their submissions showed equal performance to the precision that we could measure it. Whatever small difference there might have been, was way below the noise floor, so we couldn't say confidently that one or the other was faster.

[3] The submission passed correctness tests after adding a proper export of the `filter` function. The entry was therefore not assigned a rank in the final standings.
